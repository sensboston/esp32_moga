esp32_moga library<br>

<br>

The purpose of this code is to easily connect to MOGA gamepads using Bluetooth RFCOMM. 
These gamepads are one of a very limited number that support a non-HID communication 
mode which makes it easier for software to directly communicate with them.<br>

<br>
See the example sketch for how to use the library.
